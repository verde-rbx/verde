## What is Verde?
Verde was developed to fit new requirements that alternatives such as [Rojo](https://rojo.space) didn't meet,
at its core Verde is a file synchronization tool and is specifically designed from the ground up to boost collaboration within the Roblox ecosystem.

Gone are the days of mindlessly using Team Create. Verde removes this requirement by acting as the bridge for your files.

## Why?
- Synchronize
  
  Verde, in its basic form, is just a file synchronization tool. However, if this is all you're after it may be worth looking into [Rojo](https://rojo.space)
  as this is a more mature and well-rounded tool.

- Collaborate

  Collaboration is at the center of Verde with it's ability to remove hassle for developers. If you want to support multiple devs working on one project
  without the headaches of Team Create, Verde has you covered.
